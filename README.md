# Strawpoll-Voting-Bot
 A simple working voting bot for Strawpoll.me

# How it works
 This script behaves like a real vote on a real computer by a user. It simply opens multiple windows with driffrent proxies and votes automaticly.

# Requirements
 - Python 3
 - If you want to use proxies than you need a fast proxy list
 - A lot of patience if you use proxies :D

# How to use it
 - First make shure you have all modules installed. Simply run the install.bat
 - Then edit the config in bot.py BUT DON'T CHANGE THE CODE BELOW!!!!
 - Then you just run the script with 'py bot.py'
